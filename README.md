# User Analytics for Tracking App Usage on Mobile Devices

You may be wondering how much time we spend on our smartphones every day, given that they are glued to us wherever we go.

My teammates and I also wonder.

As a result, my team and I decided to conduct data analysis on Tracking App Usage on Mobile Devices.

## Dataset

MY team- Muhsin, Akram, Syaza and Soon will contributes the data. 

[StayFree - Stay Focused](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.burockgames.timeclocker) is the name of the app that will be installed on our devices and will be responsible for collecting the data. The application will monitor how we use our smartphones and allow us to export that data as a CSV file so that we can analyse and visualise the results.

## Data analysis and presentation

Using tableau, we will perform data analysis, create visualisations, and extract meaningful information from the visualisations.

We will use a Tableau story to present our findings.

A tableau is a series of interconnected visualisations that convey information. It is beneficial to use narratives to tell a data story, provide context, illustrate how decisions relate to outcomes, or simply make a compelling argument.

## Future work

In point of fact, the purpose of this project is to educate us on the inner workings of mobile app usage analytics.

In the long run, it will be possible to expand the project in a more extensive manner, one that is both more complicated and comprised of vast amounts of data, by utilising more advanced tools such as R shiny and Python.
